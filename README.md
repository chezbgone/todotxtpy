# todotxt-py
My personal implementation of a todotxt-like CLI, in Python. Note: this is not exactly the todotxt format, but something slightly different.
```
[done] ([priority]) [text] [project tags?] [context tags?] [key value tags?] [completion date?%] [creation date%] 
```
The items marked with a `?` are optional, and the items marked with a `%` are hidden by default.
